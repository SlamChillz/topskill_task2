# Using mongodb & mongoose, create a “MyApp” Mongo Database
- Setup input validation for your existing controllers/handlers using “Joi validation library”
- Save the response object into a “Profile” Collection
- Setup CRUD (Create, Read, Update & Delete) operation on the “Profile Collection”
- Setup api endpoints to match the corresponding CRUD Operation
- Add a single search endpoint & use the mongo filter command in performing search queries on the documents within the “Profile Collection” (You can either use the mongodb default command or the mongoose option).
- The search endpoint would accept two query params “key” and “value” where key would indicate the search key and value would indicate the search value.
